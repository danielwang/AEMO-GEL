### Welcome to the AEMO Global Experience Language (GEL), providing everything you need to know about our digital platforms to easily provide delightful and consistent customer experiences.

## What exactly is GEL

It's our centralised and single source of truth to our digital brand, design and experience. It demonstrates our key principles and approach, as well as a system of reusable interaction patterns and design components, so that you have everything you need to know about how we communicate to our customers and how we design and develop for our digital platforms, tools and products.

It's not a set of strict rules that need to be followed, but a set of guidelines and a toolkit for anyone involved in building digital tools and products at AEMO, that will evolve through it's use and application.
